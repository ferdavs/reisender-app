Reisender app

# Usage

You can get started with this using `degit`:

```bash
npx degit ferdavs/reisender reisender
cd reisender
npm install
```

Your svelte-native app will be found in the `reisender` folder.

Once installed use the `ns preview`, `ns build` or `ns run` commands as for a normal NativeScript application.

Example: install & run application on your device:

```bash
ns run android
# or
ns run ios
```
